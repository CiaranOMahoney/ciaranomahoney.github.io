I had a holiday from work and thought iwas time to get back into my coding.

Jumped back in to be reminded of how I got stuck on the pyperclip installatoin part of Automate the boring stuff. 

I tried to have this installed over a month ago,  but could never quite get it to work, even with a lot of tutorials and help from Reddit.

I then uninstalled and re-installed Python, with an upgrade to Python 3.10. At which point it said it was working, but alas, it is not.

I hope that this has become a redundant part of Python as I hope to move past it and continue learning without getting stuck and frustrated, again. 

All this stress because I can't use CTRL + C and CTRL + P.
